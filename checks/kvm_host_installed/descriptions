Check if KVM is installed and loaded

[description]
All the 5 checks/requirements are mandatory for KVM to work.

1. Check if VT-x is enabled in BIOS.

The KVM hypervisor requires:
	an Intel processor with the Intel VT-x and Intel 64 extensions for x86-based systems, or
	an AMD processor with the AMD-V and the AMD64 extensions.

2. Check if kvm.ko & processor specific kvm_intel.ko or kvm_amd.ko  kernel module is loaded.
	KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko

3. Check if qem-kvm rpm package is installed.
	To use virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise Linux you require at least the qemu-kvm and qemu-img packages. These packages provide the user-level KVM emulator and disk image manager on the host Red Hat Enterprise Linux system. 

4. Check if libvirt rpm package is installed
	The libvirt package provides the server and host side libraries for interacting with hypervisors and host systems. The libvirt package provides the libvirtd daemon.

5. Check if libvirtd daemon is running.
	libvirtd daemon handles the library calls, manages virtualized guests and controls the hypervisor. So the service should be running.
