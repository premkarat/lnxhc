[summary unusable_device]
There are unusable I/O devices (&devices_list;)

[explanation unusable_device]
Some I/O devices have an availability status other than "good". Such devices
cannot be used for I/O.

The following devices are unusable:

&all_devices;

Use the following command to list your I/O devices with their availability status:

## lscss --avail

If the "lscss" command is not available, read the sysfs availability attribute
of each device to check the availability status:

## cat /sys/bus/ccw/devices/<device_bus_id>/availability

[solution unusable_device]
 - For DASD, check whether other systems hold device reservations for the affected devices.
 - Confirm that the physical connections to the affected devices are in place and secure.
 - Run the "lscss" command to check if the channel paths to the affected devices are available.
   In the command output there is a row for each device. If the values in the columns "PIM" and "PAM" differ,
   one or more channel paths to the device are unavailable.

common sysfs attributes for CCW devices in "Device Drivers, Features, and Commands".
