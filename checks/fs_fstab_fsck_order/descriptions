Check if filesystems are skipped by filesystem check (fsck)

[description]
This check examines if the filesystems are skipped by filesystem check (fsck)
while boot. If filesystems are not checked for consistency it might lead
to filesystem corruption or drive might not even boot the system.

[param mount]
A list of filesystems, separated by colons (:). The filesystems mounted at
the specified mount points are to be checked for consistency. If the list
is empty, all mount points of /etc/fstab except in exclude list are checked.

Example:
#/:/home

[param exclude]
A list of filesystems, separated by colons (:). The filesystems mounted at
the specified mount points are to be excluded from the consistency check.
Special filesystems like /proc, /sys etc need not be checked for consistency.

Example:
#/proc:/sys
