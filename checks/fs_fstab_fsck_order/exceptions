[summary root_not_checked]
Root filesystem is not checked by filesystem check (fsck)

[explanation root_not_checked]
Root filesystem needs to be checked first before any filesystem. If root
filesystem is not checked for consistency it might corrupt the filesystem
and Linux instance might fail to start up.

[solution root_not_checked]
Replace 6th field (fs_passno) of /etc/fstab entry from 0 to 1.

For example:

If the current setting is

#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.eb7e-part1 / ext3 defaults   0  0

edit /etc/fstab to reflect the below change

#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.eb7e-part1 / ext3 defaults   0  1

[reference root_not_checked]
See the man page of the "fstab" file and "fsck" command.

[summary root_low_prio_check]
Root filesystem is checked with low priority by filesystem check (fsck)

[explanation root_low_prio_check]
Root filesystem needs to be checked first before any other filesystem.
Root filesystem contains important system related data so it needs to
be checked prior to other filesystems.

[solution root_low_prio_check]
Replace 6th field (fs_passno) of /etc/fstab entry from 2 to 1.

For example:

If the current setting is

#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.eb7e-part1 / ext3 defaults   0  2

edit /etc/fstab to reflect the below change

#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.eb7e-part1 / ext3 defaults   0  1

[reference root_low_prio_check]
See the man page of the "fstab" file and "fsck" command.

[summary filesystem_not_checked]
These filesystems are not checked by filesystem check (fsck): &filesystem_list_summary;

[explanation filesystem_not_checked]
Several filesystems are not checked for file consistency during boot time.
If the filesystems are not checked for consistency it might corrupt the
filesystem and also system might fail to come up.

These filesystems are not checked:

#&filesystem_not_checked;

[solution filesystem_not_checked]
Replace the 6th field (fs_passno) of /etc/fstab entry from 0 to 2

For example:

If the current setting is

#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.eb7e-part2 /mnt ext3 defaults   0  0

edit /etc/fstab to reflect the below change

#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.eb7e-part2 /mnt ext3 defaults   0  2
