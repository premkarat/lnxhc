Check for an excessive error ratio for outbound HiperSockets traffic

[description]
This check examines the transmit (TX) error ratio for HiperSockets network
interfaces (hsi). A high TX error ratio can be caused by one or more slow
receivers that require attention.

[param txerror_ratio]
Threshold for the percentage of TX errors by total TX packets for HiperSockets
network interfaces. If the ratio of TX errors exceeds this threshold, an
exception is raised. Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.
