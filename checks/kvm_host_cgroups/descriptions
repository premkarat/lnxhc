Check if cgroups is enabled during startup and is currently running.

[description]
The 2 checks are important to ascertain if cgroup is running and enabled during startup.

1. Check if cgroup is enabled during startup using chkconfig output.

2. Check if cgroup is currently running.

cgroups (control groups) is a Linux kernel feature to limit, account and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of process groups. By using cgroups, system administrators gain fine-grained control over allocating, prioritizing, denying, managing, and monitoring system resources. Hardware resources can be smartly divided up among tasks and users, increasing overall efficiency.
