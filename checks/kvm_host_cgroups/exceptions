[summary chkconfig_cgconfig_off]
cgroup is not enabled during startup

[explanation chkconfig_cgconfig_off]
cgroup is not enabled during startup.
	The cgconfig ( control group config) service can be configured to start up at boot time and reestablish your predefined cgroups, thus making them persistent across reboots.

[solution chkconfig_cgconfig_off]
	# chkconfig cgconfig on

[reference chkconfig_cgconfig_off]
See the chkconfig man page.

[summary cgconfig_service_failed]
cgconfig daemon is not running

[explanation cgconfig_service_failed]
cgconfig daemon is not running.
	The cgconfig service is not started by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. When you start the service with chkconfig, it reads the cgroup configuration file — /etc/cgconfig.conf. Depending on the contents of the configuration file, cgconfig can create hierarchies, mount necessary file systems, create cgroups, and set subsystem parameters for each group.
	Cgroups allow you to allocate resources—such as CPU time, system memory, network bandwidth, or combinations of these resources—among user-defined groups of tasks (processes) running on a system. You can monitor the cgroups you configure, deny cgroups access to certain resources, and even reconfigure your cgroups dynamically on a running system. 

[solution cgconfig_service_failed]
As root user, start the cgconfig daemon using
	# service cfconfig start
