[summary not_usable]
There are unusable SCSI devices &lun_summ;

[explanation not_usable]
Some SCSI devices have a state other then "running". This might indicate that
the connection to a storage system is working but the storage system has a
problem. The SCSI device is considered as being not operational and cannot be
used for I/O.

The following SCSI devices are unusable:
&lun;

Read the sysfs state attribute of each SCSI device to check the state:

For example, issue:
## cat /sys/bus/scsi/devices/<devname>/state
where <devname> is the SCSI device name

[solution not_usable]
Attempt to manually set the device online again by echoing "running" into the
sysfs state attribute.

For example, issue:
## echo "running" > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/<devname>/state
where <devname> is the SCSI device name

If the problem persists, the storage hardware might be damaged, and you should
check the storage hardware using the documentation of your Storage Server.
