Check whether N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) is active for all eligible FCP devices

[description]
This check identifies the FCP devices for which N_Port ID Virtualization is
possible but not active.  To use NPIV, the FCP devices must be attached to a
switch. The switch must support NPIV and the System z type must be z9 or
later.

With NPIV a single FCP port can register multiple worldwide port names (WWPN)
with a fabric name server. Each registered WWPN is assigned a unique N_Port ID.
NPIV requires more storage area network (SAN) resources because of the
additional virtual WWPNs. Linux can save resources by only seeing a limited
set of SCSI devices.
