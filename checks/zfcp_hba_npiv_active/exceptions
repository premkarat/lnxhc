[summary no_npiv]
The following FCP devices are not configured with NPIV: &adapter_summ;

[explanation no_npiv]
System z FCP channels require a FICON Express adapter. FCP channels can be
shared by multiple LPARs. Each port on the adapter is assigned a permanent
64-bit WWPN by the manufacturer; this is used at Fabric Login (FLOGI).

Without the NPIV feature, each operating system image that has an FCP port is
identified to the fabric by the permanent WWPN of the port. In this case, all
operating system images have the same access rights in the fabric. The
permanent WWPN of the port determines:
Zone membership for all images sharing the port
Logical Unit Number (LUN) access rights for all images sharing the port

With the NPIV feature, the Service Element (SE) creates new WWPNs for the FCP
port at FLOGI. A unique WWPN is then assigned to each operating system image
sharing the port. The generated NPIV WWPN is registered with the fabric switch
and uniquely identifies each image for fabric zoning and LUN masking.

NPIV support is available on System z9 servers and above, FICON Express 2
adapter and above.

The following FCP devices not configured with NPIV:
|Adapter|port name
&adapter;

To manually check whether NPIV support is available, use the following
commands.

To check if your System z hardware supports NPIV, issue:

## cat /proc/sysinfo

The output "Type: <value>", describes the type of System z. For Example "2094" is the "System z type z9".

To check whether the  connected port supports NPIV, issue:

## lszfcp -a

See the values for "port_name" and "permanent_port_name" at each port.
If both values are the same NPIV is not enabled.
If the values are different NPIV is enabled.

[solution no_npiv]
Enable NPIV on SE for the corresponding CHPIDs on LPAR and in the switch
adjacent to the FCP device.
If you are using the zoning or LUN masking ensure that the new NPIV enabled
FCP devices are handled correctly.
