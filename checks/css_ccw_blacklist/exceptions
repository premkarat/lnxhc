[summary online_devices_ignored]
The following I/O devices are in use although they are on the exclusion list: &sum_online_ignored;

[explanation online_devices_ignored]
Some of the I/O devices on the exclusion list are in use (online). The exclusion
list should only contain devices that are not required by the Linux instance.

If any device that is on the current exclusion list becomes unavailable and
reappears after some time, it is ignored and remains unavailable to Linux.
If a device is added to the cio_ignore parameter in the boot configuration,
it will also be unavailable after rebooting Linux.

The I/O devices with the following bus IDs are both in use and
on the exclusion list:

&online_ignored;

To display the current exclusion list issue:
#cat /proc/cio_ignore

Use the "lscss" command to investigate which I/O devices are in use. For unused
devices the "Use" column is blank; for online devices this column contains the
value "yes".

[solution online_devices_ignored]
Verify that all I/O devices on the exclusion list are not needed by your
Linux instance and are excluded intentionally.

Remove any I/O devices from the exclusion list that are on the list by mistake.
For example, use the "cio_ignore" command if your distribution provides it.
Alternatively, you can issue a command like this:
#echo free <device_bus_id> > /proc/cio_ignore

Be sure not to add required devices to the "cio_ignore" kernel parameter in the
boot configuration.
