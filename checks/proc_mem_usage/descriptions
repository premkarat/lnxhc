Ensure processes do not hog memory

[description]
This check ensures that processes do not end up hogging memory. If certain
processes start hogging memory other processes would be deprived of memory and
applications might slow down and system might even become unresponsive.

[param processes]
A list of processes separated by comma (,) that are expected to consume high
memory and which need not be reported by this check. If the list is empty, all
the processes consuming high memory are reported.

Example:
#firefox, apache2

[param mem_usage]
Per process memory usage at which to raise a high-severity exception.
Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.
