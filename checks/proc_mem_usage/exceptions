which in turn might cause applications to slow down and system might become
unresponsive.

List of processes hogging memory:

[solution process_hogs_memory]
1. If processes / applications reported are behaving as expected then you can
   avoid future reporting of such processes by adding them to the list:

   &param_processes;

2. Check if the application is configured properly.

   If step 1 and step 2 does not have any issue restart the application or you
   can terminate if its no longer required by the following command:

   #kill -9 <pidofprocess>
