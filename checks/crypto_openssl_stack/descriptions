Verify the availability of System z cryptographic hardware support through an OpenSSL stack

[description]
The applications using cryptographic operations by linking to OpenSSL libraries can exploit System z cryptographic hardware only if the OpenSSL stack is configured correctly.

The following cryptographic hardware can be exploited if available:

- CPACF instructions in the CPU
- Cryptographic Accelerator adapters
- Cryptographic Coprocessor adapters

Prerequisites for a well configured OpenSSL stack that uses System z cryptographic hardware are:

- The enablement of CPACF, a device driver to exploit cryptographic adapters (if adapters are available)
- The libica library
- The openssl-ibmca engine for OpenSSL being installed and configured

Configuring the OpenSSL stack to exploit System z cryptographic hardware accelerates applications using cryptographic functions and  offloads CPU cycles to cryptographic adapters. The availability of cryptographic adapters is optional because libica provides a software fallback for the functions provided by the adapters.

This health check verifies that:
- The Cryptographic Coprocessor or Accelerator is available
- Required RPMs, such as 'openSSL', 'openssl-ibmca', and 'libica' are available
- OpenSSL is configured with the 'ibmca' engine
