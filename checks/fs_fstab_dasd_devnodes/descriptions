Identify standard DASD device nodes in the fstab file

[description]
The DASD device driver creates standard device nodes for DASDs that are based on the order in which DASDs are set online.
When you add or remove disks, the device name of a disk might change across a reboot.
To preserve the mapping between standard device nodes and the associated physical disk space across reboot, use device nodes that are based on unique properties of a DASD and so identify a particular device.
