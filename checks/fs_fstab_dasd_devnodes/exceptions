[summary volatile_devnodes_used]
Standard DASD device nodes are used in the fstab file.

[explanation volatile_devnodes_used]
The fstab file contains standard DASD device nodes that have been created by the DASD device driver.

The DASD device driver creates standard device nodes for disks in the order in which they are set online. When you add or remove disks, the standard device node of a disk might change across a reboot. To preserve the mapping between device nodes and the associated physical disks, use device nodes that are based on unique properties for a disk. Such device nodes are independent of the sequence in which the devices are set online and can help you to reliably address an intended disk space.

The following file systems use a standard DASD device node in file /etc/fstab:
&fs_exp;

[solution volatile_devnodes_used]
Use the udev-created device nodes to be sure that you access a particular physical disk space, regardless of the device node that is assigned to it.

For example, in the file system information in /etc/fstab you could replace the following specifications:

#/dev/dasdzzz1 /temp1 ext3 defaults 0 0
#/dev/dasdzzz2 /temp2 ext3 defaults 0 0

with these specifications:

#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.b100-part1 /temp1 ext3 defaults 0 0
#/dev/disk/by-path/ccw-0.0.b100-part2 /temp2 ext3 defaults 0 0
