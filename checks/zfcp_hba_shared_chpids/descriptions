[title]
Identify FCP devices that share channel-path identifiers (CHPIDs)

[description]
A single FCP channel can be represented inside Linux by more than one CCW
device. Such a configuration is possible but does not provide an increase
in availability or I/O performance. Also extra FCP CCW devices waste FCP
channel resources especially in an N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) setup.
It can cause hardware limitations such as maximum number of open ports or
open LUNs to be be reached faster.

[param check_offline]
This parameter determines if the check is extended to offline FCP devices.
Change this value to 1 if you want to also check offline FCP devices, 0 if
you want to exclude offline devices from checking.
