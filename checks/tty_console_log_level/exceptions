[summary low_loglevel]
Current console_loglevel set is low (&console_loglevel;)

[explanation low_loglevel]
When the console_loglevel is set to a low value, user might miss out important
messages which needs user attention and also it helps user to understand what
went wrong in the system when a system crash occurs.

Current value for console_loglevel can be verified by the following command:

#sysctl -a | grep printk

You will see four values. First value represents the console_log_level.

Conventional meaning of the loglevels are:

#KERN_EMERG	0	/*system is unusable			*/
#KERN_ALERT	1	/*action must be taken immediately	*/
#KERN_CRIT	2	/*critical conditions			*/
#KERN_ERR	3	/*error conditions			*/
#KERN_WARNING	4	/*warning conditions			*/
#KERN_NOTICE	5	/*normal but significant condition	*/
#KERN_INFO	6	/*informational				*/
#KERN_DEBUG	7	/*debug-level messages			*/

console_loglevel: messages with a higher priority than current console_loglevel
will be printed to the console. Lower number has a higher priority.

[solution low_loglevel]
Its advisable to have console_loglevel set atleast to 4 (KERN_WARNING) to
receive important messages.

To set the current console_loglevel in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:

#kernel.printk = 4 4 1 7

This setting becomes active the next time the Linux instance is booted.

To temporarily set the current console_log_level issue the following command:

#sysctl -w kernel.printk="4 4 1 7"
