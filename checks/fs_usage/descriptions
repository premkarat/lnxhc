Check file systems for adequate free space

[description]
Some applications and administrative tasks require an adequate amount of free
space on each mounted file system. If there is not enough free space,
these applications might no longer be available or the complete system might be compromised. Regular monitoring of disk space usage averts this risk.

[param warn_limit]
File system usage (in percent) at which to raise a low-severity exception.
Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.

[param critical_limit]
File system usage (in percent) at which to raise a high-severity exception.
Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.

[param mount_points]
A list of mount points, separated by colons (:). The file systems mounted at
the specified mount points are to be checked for free space. If the list is
empty, all mounted file systems are checked.

Example:
#/mnt:/home/mymnt/usr/data/myapp
