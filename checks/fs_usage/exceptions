[summary warn_limit]
The warning threshold of &param_warn_limit;% disk space usage
is exceeded on some file systems (&warn_exceeded_list_summary;)

[explanation warn_limit]
The percentage of used disk space on one or more file systems has exceeded the
specified warning threshold of &param_warn_limit;%. Further increase in the amount
of used space might compromise the availability of an application
or of the complete system.

The following file systems exceed the threshold:

&warn_exceeded_list;

To view the current disk space usage, run the "df" command with no parameters.

[solution warn_limit]
Monitor the disk space usage. Also plan on freeing some
disk space. For example, consider deleting obsolete files or moving directories with growing disk space requirements to separate file systems.

[reference warn_limit]
See the man page of the "df" command.

[summary critical_limit]
The critical threshold of &param_critical_limit;% disk space usage is
exceeded on some file systems (&critical_exceeded_list_summary;)

[explanation critical_limit]
The percentage of used disk space on one or more file systems has exceeded the
specified critical threshold of &param_critical_limit;%. Further increase in the
amount of used space is likely to compromise the availability of
an application or of the complete system.

The following file systems exceed the threshold:

&critical_exceeded_list;

To view the current disk space usage, run the "df" command with no parameters.

[solution critical_limit]
Free disk space on the affected file systems. For example,
delete obsolete files and move directories with growing space
requirements to separate file systems.

[reference critical_limit]
See the man page of the "df" command.
