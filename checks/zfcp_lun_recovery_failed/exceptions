[summary lun_not_usable]
There are unusable zFCP LUNs &lun_summ;

[explanation lun_not_usable]
Some zFCP LUNs are in a state indicating that there have been problems while
trying to recover from an error.

The following zFCP LUNs indicate that recovery failed:
|zFCP LUN|Device_ID|WWPN|Failed
&lun;

To manually check the state of zFCP LUN, check the value of the associated
"failed" sysfs attribute.

For example, issue:
## cd /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/<wwpn>/
## cat <lun>/failed
where
* <device_bus_id> - is the device bus-ID that looks like x.x.xxxx
* <wwpn> - is the world wide port number that looks like 0x<16 digits>
* <lun> - is the logical unit number that looks like 0x<16 digits>

[solution lun_not_usable]
Manually trigger LUN recovery by echoing "0" into the corresponding "failed"
sysfs attribute.

For example, issue:
## cd /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/<wwpn>/
## echo 0 > <lun>/failed

Search for Storage Server errors and resolve them using the documentation of
your Storage Server.
