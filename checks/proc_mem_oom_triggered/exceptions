[summary processes_killed]
The OOM killer killed one or more processes (&process_list_summary;)

[explanation processes_killed]
Because of a severe shortage of available memory, the out-of-memory killer (OOM killer)
recovered memory by killing some processes. These processes were affected:

&processes_pid_list;

To find out more about the OOM occurrences, check /var/log/messages or the dmesg output
for entries that begin with "Out of memory".

An algorithm assigns a priority to each process. Processes with high priority get killed first
when an OOM condition occurs.

The priority is expressed as a number in /proc/<pid>/score, where <pid> is the process ID.
To investigate the priorities, use the ps command to list your processes with the process IDs,
and then read the priorities for processes of interest.

[solution processes_killed]
Restart any important processes that were killed.

To prevent OOM conditions in the future, consider adding more memory or swap space.
Also, ensure that there are no memory leaks in the applications you are running.

You can influence the priority for a process by writing a value in the range -17 to 15 to
/proc/<pid>/oom_adj, where <pid> is the process ID. The lower this value, the lower becomes
the priority in /proc/<pid>/score. For -17 the OOM killer is disabled for the process.
