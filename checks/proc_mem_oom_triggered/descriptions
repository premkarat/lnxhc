Check the kernel message log for out-of-memory (OOM) occurrences

[description]
When a Linux instance runs out of memory, the OOM killer recovers memory
by killing one or more processes. If important process get killed,
they might need to be restarted and protected from the OOM killer.

Frequent OOM occurrences indicate that too little memory is available for a given
workload or that an application is consuming an undue amount of memory.
Awareness of OOM occurrences can disclose resource shortages or help identify
malfunctioning applications.
