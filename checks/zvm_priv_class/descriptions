Check the privilege classes of the z/VM guest virtual machine on which the Linux instance runs

[description]
This check examines the z/VM privilege classes of the current z/VM guest virtual machine and compares them
with the permitted privilege classes. The permitted privilege classes are provided by the permitted_privclass
parameter.

Higher privilege classes than the permitted ones might allow operations which can inadvertently or
maliciously affect the security and availability of other z/VM guest virtual machines running in the same
z/VM instance. Generally, higher privilege classes should be assigned sparingly and only to trusted z/VM user
IDs.


[param permitted_privclass]
Privilege classes permitted for z/VM guest virtual machines.
Valid values are lists of letters in the range A to Z and integers in the range 1 to 6.

Example:
#ABCD12

[param check_for]
Privilege classes to check: privilege classes effective at run-time (currently), privilege classes
permanently defined in the user directory (directory), or both (currently, directory).
