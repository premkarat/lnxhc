[summary running_privileges_exceeded]
The currently active privilege classes '&sum_cur_extrapriv;' exceeds the maximum defined permission
'&param_permitted_privclass;'.

[explanation running_privileges_exceeded]
The run-time privilege classes of the currently active z/VM guest virtual machine exceeds the maximum
defined permission. Higher privilege classes than the permitted ones might allow operations which can
inadvertently or maliciously affect the security and availability of other z/VM guest virtual machines
running in the same z/VM instance.

The following entry has higher privileges:
Currently:	&cur_extrapriv;

Perform these steps to verify the privileges:
From Linux,
1. Load the kernel module named "vmcp", if not already loaded or built-in:
    # modprobe vmcp
2. Query the privilege class:
    # vmcp q privclass
From the console of the z/VM guest virtual machine,
   Query the privilege class:
    # cp q privclass

[solution running_privileges_exceeded]
Use the z/VM "SET PRIVCLASS" command to assign a permitted privilege class to the z/VM guest virtual machine.
Generally, the privilege class should not be higher than class G.

[summary default_privileges_exceeded]
The privilege classes '&sum_dir_extrapriv;', which are permanently defined in the z/VM user
directory of the z/VM guest, exceed the maximum defined permission '&param_permitted_privclass;'.

[explanation default_privileges_exceeded]
The privilege classes of the currently active z/VM guest virtual machine, which are permanently defined
in the z/VM user directory, exceed the maximum defined permission. Higher privilege classes than the permitted
ones might allow operations which can inadvertently or maliciously affect the security and availability of other
z/VM guest virtual machines running in the same z/VM instance.

The following entry has higher privileges:
Directory:	&dir_extrapriv;

Perform these steps to verify the privileges:
From Linux,
1. Load the kernel module named "vmcp", if not already loaded or built-in:
    # modprobe vmcp
2. Query the privilege class:
    # vmcp q privclass
From the console of the z/VM guest virtual machine,
 Query the privilege class:
# cp q privclass

[solution default_privileges_exceeded]
To change the privilege class in the z/VM user directory, either edit the user privilege class  entries manually,
or, if DirMaint is installed, use the "DirMaint" commands to modify the privilege classes.
