[title]
Check whether the recommended runlevel is used and set as default
[description]
Running Linux with an unsuitable runlevel can mean that required services are
not available, or it can mean that unnecessary processes degrade performance
or security.

Linux runlevels are usually expressed as integers in the range 0 to 6, where
0 and 6 are reserved for halt and reboot. The meaning of runlevels 1 to 5
differ between distributions. See the "init" man page of your distribution
for details.

[param recommended_runlevel]
The recommended runlevel for the Linux instance.
Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 5.
