[summary current_runlevel_differs]
The current runlevel (&current_runlevel;) does not match
the recommended runlevel (&param_recommended_runlevel;)

[explanation current_runlevel_differs]
The recommended runlevel  for the Linux instance is
&param_recommended_runlevel;, but currently runlevel &current_runlevel; is used.

Linux runlevels define which processes can run. Linux runlevels are usually
expressed as integers in the range 0 to 6. Runlevels 0 and 6 are reserved for
halt and reboot. The meaning of runlevels 1 to 5 differs between distributions.

[solution current_runlevel_differs]
To temporarily change the current run level, use the "init" command.
For example, to change the runlevel to 3 issue:
#init 3

To change the runlevel that is used after booting Linux, change the
default runlevel in /etc/inittab. For example, to change the default runlevel
from 5 to 3 change the line
#id:5:initdefault
to
#id:3:initdefault
In this line, the entry identifier before the first colon depends on the
distribution and need not be "id" as shown in the example.

If Linux uses the correct runlevel, adjust the "recommended_runlevel" check
parameter accordingly to prevent this warning in the future.

current runlevel, see "init" man page.
