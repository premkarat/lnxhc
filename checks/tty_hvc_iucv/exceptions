[summary unused_ttys]
These z/VM IUCV terminals are not enabled for user logins: &hvc_short_list;

[explanation unused_ttys]
The z/VM IUCV Hypervisor Console (HVC) device driver provides you with
access to the Linux instance using the z/VM Inter-User Communication
Vehicle (IUCV).  With this setup, you can log in to the Linux instance
with no external network connection.

The current setup has &num_hvc_iucv; HVC terminal devices that are
managed by the z/VM IUCV HVC device driver.
The following &num_hvc_req; HVC terminals are not enabled for user
logins:

&hvc_dev_list;

HVC terminals that are not enabled for logins serve no purpose and
cannot provide access to the Linux instance in emergencies.


[solution unused_ttys]
Enable each HVC terminal for user logins by starting a getty program
on the terminal device.
Alternatively, you can use the hvc_iucv= kernel parameter to reduce
the number of z/VM IUCV HVC terminals.

[summary too_few_ttys]
Number of z/VM IUCV HVC terminals are below the required minimum


[explanation too_few_ttys]
The z/VM IUCV Hypervisor Console (HVC) device driver provides you with
access to the Linux instance using the z/VM Inter-User Communication
Vehicle (IUCV).  With this setup, you can log in to the Linux instance
with no external network connection.

The current setup has &hvc_iucv_avail; HVC terminal devices which is
below the required minimum of &param_min_hvc_iucv; devices.

HVC terminals that are not available cannot provide access to the
Linux instance in emergencies.


[solution too_few_ttys]
Use the hvc_iucv= kernel parameter to increase the number of
z/VM IUCV HVC terminals.
Alternatively, reduce the min_hvc_iucv check parameter.
