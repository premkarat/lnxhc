Ensure kdump is configured and running

[description]
This check examines if kdump is configured and running on the system. If kdump
is not running and a system crash occurs, crash dump will not be captured and
system will not be available for use. Kdump allows the system to come back
after crash along with crash dump which can be used for post-morterm analysis.
