[summary no_kdump_crash]
kdump is not configured

[explanation no_kdump_crash]
Your Linux instance does not have the crashkernel loaded. In case a kernel panic
occurs it would not be able to automatically capture the dump for post-morterm
analysis.

[solution no_kdump_crash]
1. If memory is not reserved for crashkernel, reserve it by passing the
   crashkernel= kernel parameter.

   If the crashkernel= kernel parameter is already specified, check for the
   proper values of the crashkernel parameter. Refer to the appropriate
   distribution's configuration settings.

   #crashkernel=X@Y

   X is the size of the crashkernel.

   Y is the offset at which crashkernel will be loaded.

   Once crashkernel= parameter is specified with right offset and size confirm
   if memory is reserved for crashkernel either by issuing:

   1. #cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size

      It should be a non-zero value.

      or

   2. #dmesg | head

      It will indicate the memory reserved for crashkernel. In case memory
      reservation fails it contains relevant error messages.

2. Load the kdump kernel and initrd using the kexec-tools suite.

Typically, this setup is done for you by your Linux distribution.

[summary no_kdump]
Kdump is not operational

[explanation no_kdump]
Your Linux instance's kdump is not operational. In case a kernel panic occurs it
would not be able to automatically capture the dump for post-morterm analysis.

You can confirm the kdump status by issuing following command:

For Redhat:

#service kdump status

For Suse:

#service boot.kdump status

[solution no_kdump]
There is a possibility of kdump service being stopped. Restart the kdump
service by issuing the following command:

For Redhat:

#service kdump restart

For Suse:

#service boot.kdump restart
