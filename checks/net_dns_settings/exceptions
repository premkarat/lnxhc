[summary no_nameserver]
Nameserver is not listed

[explanation no_nameserver]
Nameserver helps to convert names to numeric ip addresses. If nameserver is not
listed in resolv.conf file it would prevent accessing any of the systems in the
network by their name.

[solution no_nameserver]
Edit the /etc/resolv.conf and add the nameserver address.

#nameserver <ip address>

You can confirm if the nameserver address is right and name resolution is working
fine by "host" command.

#host <ip> <ip>

where <ip> is the nameserver address, a reverse DNS lookup happens for
<ip> (Second parameter) using the DNS server at address <ip> (first paramater)
it will give details of domain server.

or you can also confirm by

#host <domain_name>

[reference no_nameserver]
Refer to man pages of "resolv.conf" file and "host" command.

[summary incorrect_nameserver]
System has incorrect nameserver address

[explanation incorrect_nameserver]
Nameserver helps to convert names to numeric ip addresses. Having an incorrect
nameserver address would prevent accessing any of the systems in the network by
their name. Adding more than one nameserver would help in better name resolution
in a case where previous nameserver fails to resolve the name.

Currently 3 nameservers can be listed.

Incorrect nameservers are
&invalid_nameservers;

[solution incorrect_nameserver]
Edit the /etc/resolv.conf and add the nameserver address.

#nameserver <ip address>

You can confirm if the name resolution is working fine by "host" command.

#host <ip> <ip>

where <ip> is the nameserver address, a reverse DNS lookup happens for
<ip> (Second parameter) using the DNS server at address <ip> (first parameter)
it will give details of domain server.
