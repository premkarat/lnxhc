[summary service_disabled]
The "multipathd" daemon is not configured to start automatically at every boot
 or reboot

[explanation service_disabled]
The "multipathd" daemon should be configured to start at every boot or reboot,
in case of existing "multipath" targets. If not configured at the boot time,
the "multipathd" service will not start automatically and cannot be used.

The multipathd daemon is in charge of re-enabling failed paths. When this
happens, it will reconfigure the multipath map the path belongs to, so that
this map regains its maximum performance and redundancy.

To manually check whether the "multipathd" service was configured at the
boot time or not, use the following commands:

For Linux systems using chkconfig (for example: SLES11, RHEL6), issue:

## chkconfig --list | grep "multipathd"

Example output:

#multipathd      0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on   4:off   5:off   6:off

This output shows, that the "multipathd" service is on in runlevel "3".

For Linux systems using systemctl (for example: Fedora 19), issue:

## systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep "multipathd"

Example output:

#multipathd.service                        enabled

This output shows, that the "multipathd.service" is "enabled".

[solution service_disabled]
Configure the "multipathd" service to run at every boot or reboot.

For Linux systems using chkconfig (for example: SLES11, RHEL6), issue:

## chkconfig multipathd on

For Linux systems using systemctl (for example: Fedora 19), issue:

## systemctl enable multipathd.service

[reference service_disabled]
Refer to the man pages of "runlevel", "chkconfig" and "systemctl"
command.

[summary service_not_running]
The "multipathd" daemon does not run

[explanation service_not_running]
The  multipathd  daemon checks for failed paths. In this case, the multipath
map will be reconfigured to resume its maximum performance and redundancy.

To manually check if the "multipathd" service is running or not, enter the
following command:

For Linux systems using chkconfig (for example: SLES11, RHEL6), issue:

## service multipathd status

For Linux systems using systemctl (for example: Fedora 19), issue:

## systemctl status multipathd.service

[solution service_not_running]
Start the "multipathd" service if it is in a stopped state.

For Linux systems using chkconfig (for example: SLES11, RHEL6), issue:

## service multipathd start

For Linux systems using systemctl (for example: Fedora 19), issue:

## systemctl start multipathd.service

[reference service_not_running]
Refer to the man pages of "systemctl" and "service" command.
