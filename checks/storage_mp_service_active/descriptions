Verify that the multipath service starts automatically when the system launches

[description]
This check identifies, if the "multipathd" daemon is active and configured to
start at every boot or reboot, in case of existing "multipath" targets.
If not configured at the boot time the "multipathd" service will not start
automatically and cannot be used.
The multipathd daemon is in charge of re-enabling failed paths. When this
happens, it will reconfigure the multipath map the path belongs to, so that
this map regains its maximum performance and redundancy.
