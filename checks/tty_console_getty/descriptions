Spot getty programs on the /dev/console device

[description]
In Linux, /dev/console is a generic device node that, depending on
the environment and setup, is mapped to one of the available terminal
devices (TTY).  This terminal device is then represented by its own,
specific device node and by /dev/console.
If getty programs are configured for both device nodes, they interfere
with each other, so that users cannot log in.
