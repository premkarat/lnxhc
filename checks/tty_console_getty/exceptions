[summary getty_on_console]
A getty program runs on the /dev/console device

[explanation getty_on_console]
The /dev/console device is a generic output device to which the Linux kernel
writes messages.
Depending on the environment and setup, /dev/console is mapped to one of the
available terminal devices (TTY).  This terminal device is then represented
by its own, specific device node and by /dev/console.

You enable user logins by configuring a getty program for a terminal device
node.  If getty programs are configured for two device nodes that both map
to the same terminal device, the getty programs interfere with each other,
so that users cannot log in.

With the console= kernel parameter you can control to which terminal device
/dev/console is mapped.  With a getty program on /dev/console, changing this
mapping can easily result in blocked user logins.

A process for console with a getty or login program indicates that a getty
program is configured for /dev/console.
On a running Linux instance, issue "ps -ef" to see the details for the
current processes.

[solution getty_on_console]
Modify your system boot configuration to avoid starting a getty
program on the /dev/console device.  Instead, configure getty
programs on terminal devices that are available in your environment.

See the documentation for your system initialization.  For example,
if your distribution uses the SysV approach, see the inittab man page, or
if your distribution uses Upstart, see the init man page of section 5.
