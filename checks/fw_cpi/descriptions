Check if control program identification can display meaningful
Linux instance names

[description]
You can use the control program identification (CPI) to assign names to
your Linux instances.  The names are used to identify Linux instances,
for example, on the Hardware Management Console (HMC) or the service
element (SE).

To assign meaningful names to your Linux instances, the CPI needs names
for your Linux system and sysplex.
