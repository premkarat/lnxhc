[summary no_sysplex_name]
No sysplex name has been set

[explanation no_sysplex_name]
No sysplex name was set for your Linux instance.
The control program identification (CPI) feature uses the sysplex name to
identify a Linux instance, for example, on the Hardware Management Console
(HMC).

[solution no_sysplex_name]
You can use the attribute sysplex_name in sysfs to specify a sysplex name:

#/sys/firmware/cpi/sysplex_name

The sysplex name is a string consisting of up to 8 characters of the following
set: A-Z, 0-9, $, @, #, and blank.

To set a sysplex name for a Linux instance, for example SYSPLEX1, issue:

## echo SYSPLEX1 > /sys/firmware/cpi/sysplex_name
## echo 1 > /sys/firmware/cpi/set

Depending on your Linux distribution, you can edit /etc/sysconfig/cpi to
persistently set a sysplex name.

[summary no_system_name]
No system name has been set

[explanation no_system_name]

## echo 1 > /sys/firmware/cpi/set

Depending on your Linux distribution, you can edit /etc/sysconfig/cpi to
persistently set a system name.
