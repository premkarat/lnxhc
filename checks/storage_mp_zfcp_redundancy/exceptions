[summary single_point_of_failure]
Some disks lack redundancy

[explanation single_point_of_failure]
The following "WWID" numbers represent the disks which have a single
point of failure.

|WWID|CHPID|Device bus-ID|WWPN
&spof_info_table;

NOTE: The "-" character in the preceding table indicates, that
no single point of failure for that particular field type was found.

In case of any failure the corresponding disk is inaccessible.

To manually verify the problem, list all paths to a disk.
Issue the command:

## multipath -l

This command lists all device names "/dev/sdxx" followed by their SCSI host,
SCSI channel, SCSI target and SCSI LUN (HCTL). Each Linux device node (or
SCSI HCTL) represents a path (consisting of host, port and LUN
information). That path can be inspected with the command:

## lszfcp -D

None of the devices listed by the "multipath -l" command  may contain a
host port or a target port that is a single point of failure. Therefore,
two points of failures need to be observed:

 1. The single WWPN.
 2. The single CHPID.

[solution single_point_of_failure]
Configure additional paths for all disks that are connected via a single
point of failure. This may require the usage of additional hardware, for example
FCP channels, or target ports (WWPNs).
