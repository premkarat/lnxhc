Check whether each disk is accessible via two or
more host ports and two or more target ports (WWPNs)

[description]
If all paths to a disk go through a single host or a single target port,
this host port or target port is a single point of failure for the
access to that device. Each disk in a multipath setup needs to be
checked for a single point of failure.
