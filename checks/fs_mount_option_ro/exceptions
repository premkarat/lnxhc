[summary read_only_filesystem]
One or more filesystems have been mounted as read-only

[explanation read_only_filesystem]
Filesystems mounted as read-only would inhibit filesystem operations on the
drives like editing, deleting files/folders etc.

The following filesystems have been mounted as read-only:

&read_only_filesystems;

To view the mount points with their respective options, run the "mount" command
with no parameters.

[solution read_only_filesystem]
Read-only filesystems can be remounted as read-write by the following command:

#mount -o remount,rw <device> <mount_point>

where device is the read-only filesystem mounted on mount_point

If a filesystem has been intentionally mounted as read-only for security
reasons, remove the filesystem mount point from the mount_points check
parameter.

[reference read_only_filesystem]
See the man page of the "mount" command.
