[summary cpacf_not_enabled]
CPACF is not enabled

[explanation cpacf_not_enabled]
The CP Assist for Cryptographic Functions (CPACF) feature is not enabled.
As a result, hardware-based acceleration of cryptographic operations is not
available in the OpenSSL stack, the clear key openCryptoki stack and in the
Linux kernel. The following health checks will be not applicable:

 * crypto_openssl_stack and crypto_openssl_stack_32bit
 * crypto_opencryptoki_ckc and crypto_opencryptoki_ckc_32bit

In addition the usage of protected key cryptography is not available to
CCA based secure key cryptography stacks (see health checks crypto_cca_stack,
crypto_opencryptoki_skc, and crypto_opencryptoki_skc_32bit).

To establish whether CPACF has been enabled on your hardware, issue:
## cat /proc/cpuinfo
If CPACF has been enabled, the listed features include "msa".

[solution cpacf_not_enabled]
CPACF is activated using a no-charge enablement feature, FC 3863.

Contact your System z support team for further assistance.

[reference cpacf_not_enabled]
None.
