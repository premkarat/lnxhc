Confirm that the dump-on-panic function is enabled

[description]
With the dump-on-panic function enabled, a dump is automatically
created if a kernel panic occurs.  Without this function you have
to create a dump yourself.  Dumps can only be created if dump tools
and possibly dump devices are in place.
