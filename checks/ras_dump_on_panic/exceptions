[summary     no_kdump]
kdump is not configured

[explanation no_kdump]
Your Linux instance is not configured for kdump.  Enable kdump
to automatically create a dump if a kernel panic occurs.

[solution    no_kdump]
You typically configure kdump with tools provided by your Linux distribution.

To manually configure kdump, complete these steps:

  1. Use the crashkernel= kernel parameter to reserve memory for
     the crash kernel.  For example, specify crashkernel=128M.
  2. Issue the zipl command and reboot your Linux instance.
  3. Load the kdump kernel and initrd using the kexec-tools suite.
     For example,

     ## kexec -p <image> --initrd <initrd> --command-line "<kparms>"

     where <image> specifies the kdump image and <initrd> specifies the
     initial RAM disk of the kdump kernel.  The <initrd> can be omitted
     if the kdump kernel does not require an initial RAM disk.
     The <kparms> option specifies kernel parameters for the kdump kernel.

[summary     no_kdump_standalone]
dumpconf is not configured as kdump fallback

[explanation no_kdump_standalone]
The standalone dump configuration using dumpconf is not configured as a
fallback for kdump.

[solution    no_kdump_standalone]
To configure a fallback for an existing kdump setup, complete these steps:

  1. Plan and prepare your dump device.
  2. Edit /etc/sysconfig/dumpconf and configure the dump-on-panic action.
     Possible actions are dump, dump_reipl, or vmcmd with a CP VMDUMP command.
  3. Activate the dumpconf service with chkconfig and then start the service.

The dumpconf service is not active

[explanation no_kdump_dumpconf]
Your Linux instance is configured for dump-on-panic as a fallback for
an existing kdump setup, but the dumpconf service is not automatically
started during the boot process.

[solution    no_kdump_dumpconf]
To configure and activate the dump service, complete these steps:

  1. Edit /etc/sysconfig/dumpconf and configure the dump-on-panic action.
