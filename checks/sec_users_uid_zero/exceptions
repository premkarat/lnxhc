[summary non_root_uid0]
These users with UID 0 are not listed as trusted superusers: (&non_root_user_ids;)

[explanation non_root_uid0]
Users with numerical user ID (UID) 0 run with superuser privileges that are
conventionally associated with user "root". These users and the processes they
start can inadvertently or maliciously disrupt, damage, manipulate, or destroy
a system. Generally, UID 0 must be assigned sparingly and only to trusted
user names. Security policies often restrict UID 0 to user name "root".

The "trusted_superusers" parameter of this check identifies the following
user names as trusted to run with UID 0:

&param_trusted_superusers;

The following user names are not in the list of trusted superusers but run
with UID 0:

&non_uid_root_list;

Note: The usernames added from external services will start with symbols '+,-'.
These usernames will not be reported.
For example:
 #+username
 #+
 #+@username
 #-username
 #-
 #-@username

[solution non_root_uid0]
Examine the list of user names that run with UID 0 and assess whether they need
to be superusers and can be trusted with superuser privileges.

For user names that should not or need not run as superusers, change the UID
from 0 to a non-zero unused UID. For example, issue a command like this:
#usermod -u <UID> <user name>

To prevent this check from issuing further warnings about legitimate
superusers, add their user names to the "trusted_superusers" check parameter.
