[summary module_not_loaded]
System z cryptography kernel module is not loaded

[explanation module_not_loaded]
The System z cryptography kernel module named 'z90crypt' or 'zcrypt_pcixcc' or
'zcrypt_cex2a' is not loaded. When this kernel module is not loaded, the Linux
system cannot exploit cryptographic adapters.

Secure key cryptographic functions and true random number generation are only
supported if the system has access to a cryptographic coprocessor adapter. RSA
operations are supported by both coprocessor and accelerator adapters. Some
applications or libraries will emulate clear key RSA operations in software if
no cryptographic adapters are accessible, but this emulation will decrease the
system performance exceedingly.

While the kernel module is not loaded, the following health checks will also be
not applicable:

 * crypto_cca_stack
 * crypto_opencryptoki_skc and crypto_opencryptoki_skc_32bit

In addition acceleration and off-loading of RSA operations is not possible in
cryptographic clear key. This affects the following checks:

 * crypto_openssl_stack and crypto_openssl_stack_32bit
 * crypto_opencryptoki_ckc and crypto_opencryptoki_ckc_32bit

To verify whether System z cryptography kernel module is loaded, issue:

## lsmod | grep "<Module name>"

where <Module name> is the name of the System z cryptography kernel module.

[solution module_not_loaded]
To use secure key cryptography you need access to a cryptographic coprocessor.
If the system has access to one or more cryptographic adapters, load the System z cryptography kernel module using the command:

## modprobe "<Module name>"

where <Module name> is the name of the System z cryptography kernel module.
Note that loading the kernel module may result in an error message when there
are no cryptographic adapters installed.

For more information about various kernel module parameters, see the 'Generic
cryptographic device driver' chapter in  'Device Drivers, Features, and
Commands'.

If there are no cryptographic adapters installed on your system set the
status of this check to inactive.
