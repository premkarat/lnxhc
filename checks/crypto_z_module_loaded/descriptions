Confirm that the System z cryptography kernel module is loaded

[description]
Loading the System z cryptography kernel module (named 'z90crypt or
'zcrypt_pcixcc' or 'zcrypt_cex2a') is required to exploit cryptographic
adapters. This check verifies that the kernel module is loaded.

The System z cryptography kernel module is a mandatory prerequisite for
cryptographic operations in the following contexts:

 * the secure key openCryptoki (PKCS#11) software stack (see also checks
   crypto_opencryptoki_skc and crypto_opencryptoki_skc_32bit)
 * the Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) software stack (see also check
   crypto_cca_stack)

In addition the module is a prerequisite for accelerating and off-loading RSA
operations in the following contexts:

 * the OpenSSL software stack (see also checks crypto_openssl_stack and
   crypto_openssl_stack_32bit)
 * the clear key openCryptoki (PKCS#11) software stack (see also checks
   crypto_opencryptoki_ckc and crypto_opencryptoki_ckc_32bit)

In these contexts RSA operations will be computed in software if the
cryptographic kernel module is not available.

Finally, loading the kernel module is also required to implement true random
number generation based on cryptographic adapter hardware.
