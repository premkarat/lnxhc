Verify that syslog files are rotated

[description]
Syslog files contain the messages that are generated by the system components. If the size of the syslog files is not controlled, they might completely fill up your file system, and cause the Linux instance to run out of disk space.

logrotate is a tool that monitors, rotates, compresses, or truncates syslog files to save disk space and to limit the syslog file size. This health check verifies that logrotate runs at regular intervals on your system and checks your logrotate configuration settings.

[param max_log_size]
Maximum syslog file size, specified in KB, MB, or GB.
