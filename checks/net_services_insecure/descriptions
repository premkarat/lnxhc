Identify network services that are known to be insecure

[description]
This check finds network services that are active but known to be insecure.
Such services can compromise your data and system security. An example of an
insecure network service is a network file system service that does not provide
user authentication. Any user who can reach this service can access the data.
Other network services might be considered insecure because they do not encrypt
credentials and data. If network traffic from such services is intercepted,
data might be disclosed to unauthorized parties and the system might become
vulnerable to intrusion.

Examples of insecure network services are ftp, rsh, rlogin, and telnet.
