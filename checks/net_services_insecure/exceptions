[summary insecure_services]
One or more active network services are known to be insecure: (&insecure_services_summary;)

[explanation insecure_services]
Insecure network services can, potentially, compromise your data and system
security. Insecure services might lack user authentication or transmit
credentials and data without encryption.

The following insecure network services are active on your system:

&insecure_services_list;

[solution insecure_services]
Secure your system, for example, by taking one or more of the following actions:

- Disable any insecure network services that are not required. For example,
  to disable telnet issue:

  ## chkconfig telnet off

- Instead of the insecure network services, use network services that provide
  SSL/TLS encryption features. For example, use SSH File Transfer Protocol
  (SFTP) or FTP-SSL instead of FTP.

- Set up a firewall to prevent unauthorized parties from accessing the insecure
  network services.

- Make sure the services are only available on secured network connections.

To prevent exception messages about services that you are aware of and do not
consider a threat, remove these services from the "insecure_services" parameter.
