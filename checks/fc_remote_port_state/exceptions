[summary rports_not_usable]
There are unusable Fibre Channel (FC) remote ports: &rport_summ;

[explanation rports_not_usable]
Some remote ports have a state other than "Online". Such remote ports cannot be
used for connecting to I/O devices.

The following remote ports are unusable:

|Remote Target Port|FC Host Bus ID|WWPN|State
&rport;

Read the sysfs port_state attribute of each remote port to check the port
state:

For example, issue:
## cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/<rport>/port_state
where <rport> is an unusable Fibre Channel remote port.

[solution rports_not_usable]

your Storage Server.
