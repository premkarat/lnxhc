Verify the availability of System z cryptographic hardware support through a Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) stack

[description]
Applications using cryptographic operations by linking to CCA libraries can only exploit System z cryptography hardware if the CCA stack is configured correctly.

Cryptographic coprocessor adapters must be available. Prerequisites for a well configured CCA stack that uses System z cryptographic hardware is a device driver to exploit cryptographic adapters, and the csulcca library.

The CCA stack is required for secure key cryptography operations.

This health check verifies that:
- The Cryptographic Coprocessor is available
- Required RPMs, such as 'csulcca', are available
