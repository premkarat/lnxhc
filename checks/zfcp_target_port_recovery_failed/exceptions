[summary port_not_usable]
The recovery of these target ports failed: &failed_ports_summ;

[explanation port_not_usable]
The target ports with the following device bus-IDs and worldwide port names
(WWPN), are unable to recover from failures and cannot be used:

|Device bus-ID|WWPN
&failed_ports_table;

To manually verify if the problem still exists, read the content of this
file:

## cat /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/<wwpn>/failed

An output of "1" signifies that the problem  still existis. An output of "0"
signifies that the problem does not exist.

[solution port_not_usable]
If the recovery failed, please perform these manual steps:

1. Check for zfcp kernel messages and the FCP hardware.
2. Verify that the WWPN is correct.
3. Check the fibre channel fabric for errors related to the WWPN.
4. Check the storage target for failed port login attempts.
5. If the root cause is resolved, write "0" to the failed attribute.
   Issue the following command at the shell prompt:
   ## echo 0 > /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/<wwpn>/failed
6. Wait for 5 seconds.
7. Issue the following command to ensure that all udev events have been
   processed:
   ## udevadm settle
8. Check the value of the failed attribute.
   For example, issue:
   ## cat /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/<wwpn>/failed
   If the value is "1" the recovery failed again, because the root cause
   resolution in steps 1-4 was not sufficient.
