Check if the recovery of a target port failed

[description]
A failed target port recovery indicates a problem in the FCP
channel, the fibre channel fabric or link, or in the storage server. As
a result, none of the LUNs attached through this port are available.
This health check detects the failure when the recovery of the failed
target port was initiated by the zfcp device driver, and the recovery failed.
