Verify the availability of System z cryptographic hardware support for PKCS#11 secure key cryptographic operations

[description]
Secure key cryptographic operations require a Cryptographic Coprocessor. In order to use secure key cryptography via the Public Key Cryptographic Standard 11 (PKCS#11) API, openCryptoki together with the CCA token must be installed and configured correctly.

This health check verifies that:
- The Cryptographic Coprocessor is available
- Required RPMs, such as 'openCryptoki', and 'csulcca' are available
- openCryptoki is initialized
- The CCA token is configured
