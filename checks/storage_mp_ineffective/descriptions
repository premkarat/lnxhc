Identify multipath setups that consist of a single path only

[description]
Through a correctly configured multipath setup, a Linux instance has two or
more independent connections to the same physical storage device. This path
redundancy can be used for load balancing and to maintain availability if one
of the paths fails. Multipath setups with only a single path cannot achieve
either of these goals.
