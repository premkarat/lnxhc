[summary insecure_enabled]
There are insecure terminals on which root logins are permitted

[explanation insecure_enabled]
Listing a terminal in /etc/securetty permits root logins
on this terminal.
Permitting root logins on insecure terminals constitutes
a security exposure.

The following terminals are listed in /etc/securetty but
have been specified as insecure:

&list_insecure;


[solution insecure_enabled]
Remove the terminal from /etc/securetty.  Alternatively,
if you consider the terminal secure, remove the terminal
from the insecure_ttys check parameter.


[reference insecure_enabled]
See the man pages of the "login" program, the "pam_securetty"
module, and the "securetty" configuration file.



[summary secure_disabled]
There are secure terminals on which root logins are not permitted

[explanation secure_disabled]
Root logins are permitted only on terminals that are listed in
the /etc/securetty file.
Restricting root logins can prevent system access in emergencies.


The following terminals have been specified as secure but
are not listed in /etc/securetty:

&list_secure;


[solution secure_disabled]
Append the terminal to the /etc/securetty file.  Alternatively,
if you consider the terminal insecure, remove the terminal from
the secure_ttys check parameter.


[reference secure_disabled]
See the man pages of the "login" program, the "pam_securetty"
module, and the "securetty" configuration file.
