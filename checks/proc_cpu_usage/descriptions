Ensure processes do not hog cpu time

[description]
This check ensures that processes do not end up hogging cpu time. If certain
processes start hogging cpu time then other processes would be deprived of cpu
time which might cause applications to slow down and the system might even
become unresponsive.

[param processes]
A list of processes separated by comma (,) that are expected to consume high
cpu time and which need not be reported by this check. If the list is empty,
all the processes consuming high cpu time are reported.

Example:
#firefox, apache2

[param cpu_usage]
Per process cpu usage at which to raise a high-severity exception.
The cpu usage represents the percentage of time that a process spent
running during its lifetime.

Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.

[param cpu_time]
Per process accumulated cpu time in seconds which must be exceeded before an
exception is reported.

Valid values are integers starting with 1.
