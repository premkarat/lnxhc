[summary warn_limit]
Memory usage (&warn_limit;%) crosses warning threshold &param_warn_limit;%

[explanation warn_limit]
The percentage of memory usage has exceeded the specified warning threshold of
&param_warn_limit;%. Further increase in the memory usage might invoke
Out of memory (OOM) and also make the system unresponsive.

Memory consumption details:

#&mem_used; MB memory used

#&swap_used; MB swap used

Memory usage can be checked with the "free" command.

Total memory available is Mem:total + Swap:total.

Total memory used is -/+ buffers:used + Swap:used.

[solution warn_limit]
1. Check if any processes are unnecessarily hogging memory and terminate them.

2. Increase the swap space size.

3. Increase RAM size.

[reference warn_limit]
Refer to man pages of "free" , "sync" commands and "proc" file system.

[summary critical_limit]
Memory usage (&critical_limit;%) crosses critical threshold &param_critical_limit;%

[explanation critical_limit]
The percentage of memory usage has exceeded the specified critical threshold of
&param_critical_limit;%. Further increase in the memory usage might invoke
Out of memory (OOM) and also make the system unresponsive.
