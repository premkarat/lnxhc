Check the inbound network traffic for an excessive error or drop ratio

[description]
This check examines network interfaces for a high received (RX) error ratio or
high ratio of dropped RX packets. Problems with received packets lead to
performance degradation as packets have to be resent by the originator.
High RX error and drop ratios can be caused by insufficient memory.

[param rxerror_ratio]
Threshold for the percentage of RX errors by total RX packets. If the ratio of
RX errors exceeds this threshold for a network interface, an exception message
is issued. Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.

[param rxdrop_ratio]
Threshold for the percentage of dropped RX packets by total RX packets. If the
ratio of dropped RX packets exceeds this threshold for a network interface, an
exception message is issued. Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.
