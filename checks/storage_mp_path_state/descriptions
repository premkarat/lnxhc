[title]
Identify multipath devices with too few available paths or too many failed paths

[description]
Through a correctly configured multipath setup, a Linux instance has two or
more independent connections to the same physical storage device. This path
redundancy can be used for load balancing and to maintain availability if one
of the paths fails. Multipath setups with an insufficient number of available paths or an excessive number of failed paths might not meet these goals.
[param failed_path_limit]
Maximum number of failed hardware paths to be tolerated for a multipath device.

[param remaining_path_limit]
Minimum number of available hardware paths to be required for a multipath device.
