[summary no_panic_on_oops]
The panic-on-oops setting is disabled

[explanation no_panic_on_oops]
Without the panic-on-oops setting, a Linux instance might keep
running after experiencing a kernel oops.  After the oops, the
instance might work incorrectly and possibly damage data.

[solution no_panic_on_oops]
Activate panic-on-oops through the following setting in the
/etc/sysctl.conf file:

#kernel.panic_on_oops = 1

This setting becomes active the next time the Linux instance is booted.

To temporarily activate panic-on-oops on a running Linux instance,
issue the following command:

#sysctl -w kernel.panic_on_oops=1

[reference no_panic_on_oops]
See the man pages of the "sysctl" command and of the "sysctl.conf"
configuration file.
