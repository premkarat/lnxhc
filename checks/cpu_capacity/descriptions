Check whether the CPUs run with reduced capacity

[description]
External events or reconfigurations might cause CPUs to run with
reduced capacity.
This check examines the CPU capacity-adjustment indication and
capacity-change reason codes of the System z mainframe.


[param acceptable_cap_adj]
The lowest acceptable CPU capacity-adjustment indication.
The default value is 100, for regular capacity.  Lower values indicate
reduced capacity.  An exception is raised if the System z mainframe
reports a capacity-adjustment indication below this value.

Change this value only if your System z mainframe intentionally runs
with reduced capacity, for example, in power-saving mode.
Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.


[param expected_cap_rs]
The expected capacity-change reason.
The default value is 0, for regular operations without capacity changes.
An exception is raised if the System z mainframe reports a capacity-change
reason other than this value.

Change this value to 1 if your System z mainframe runs in power-saving mode.
