[summary capacity_reduced]
The System z mainframe runs with reduced capacity

[explanation capacity_reduced]
The CPUs of the System z mainframe run with reduced capacity, for example,
in power-saving mode.  This affects all Linux and other operating system
instances running on this particular System z hardware.

Apart from intentional configuration for power-saving, reduced capacity
can result from, for example, overheating of the hardware.

The lowest acceptable capacity-adjustment indication is
"&param_acceptable_cap_adj;" with a capacity-change reason
"&param_expected_cap_rs;".

The current capacity-adjustment indication is "&cap_adj_ind;" with a
capacity-change reason "&cap_ch_rs;".

You can find the current capacity-adjustment values in /proc/sysinfo.
Look for the "Capacity Adj. Ind." and  "Capacity Ch. Reason" entries.


[solution capacity_reduced]
If your System z mainframe intentionally runs with reduced capacity,
adjust the check parameters accordingly to prevent this check from
raising further exceptions.
In other cases, contact your hardware support team.
