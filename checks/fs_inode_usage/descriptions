Check file systems for an adequate number of free inodes

[description]
Many Linux file systems maintain metadata about file system objects
(for example, files or folders) in inodes. Each object has a separate inode.
When a file system runs out of free inodes, no further files or folders
can be created, even if plenty of free disk space is available.

Some applications and administrative tasks require an adequate number of free
inodes on each mounted file system. If there are not enough free inodes,
these applications might no longer be available or the complete system might
be compromised. Regular monitoring of inode usage can avert this risk.

[param warn_limit]
Usage of the available inodes of the file system (in percent) at which to raise
a low-severity exception. Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.

[param critical_limit]
Usage of the available inodes of the file system (in percent) at which to raise
a high-severity exception. Valid values are integers in the range 1 to 100.

[param mount_points]
A list of mount points, separated by colons (:). The file systems mounted at
the specified mount points are to be checked for free inodes. If the list is
empty, all mounted file systems are checked.

Example:
#/mnt:/home/mymnt:/usr/data/myapp
