[summary warn_limit]
The warning threshold of &param_warn_limit;% inode usage
is exceeded on some file systems (&warn_exceeded_list_summary;)

[explanation warn_limit]
The percentage of used inodes on one or more file systems has exceeded the
specified warning threshold of &param_warn_limit;%.

Many Linux file systems maintain metadata about file system objects
(for example, files or folders) in inodes. Each object has a separate inode
When a file system runs out of free inodes, no further files or folders
can be created, even if plenty of free disk space is available.

Further increase in the number of used inodes might compromise the availability
of an application or of the complete system.

The following file systems exceed the threshold:

&warn_exceeded_list;

To view the current inode usage, run the "df -i" command with no parameters.

[solution warn_limit]
Monitor the disk inode usage.
Consider deleting obsolete files or moving directories to free some inodes.

[reference warn_limit]
See the man page of the "df" command.

[summary critical_limit]
The critical threshold of &param_critical_limit;% inode usage is exceeded on some file systems (&critical_exceeded_list_summary;)

[explanation critical_limit]
The percentage of used inodes on one or more file systems has exceeded the
specified critical threshold of &param_critical_limit;%.

Many Linux file systems maintain metadata about file system objects
(for example, files or folders) in inodes. Each object has a separate inode.
When a file system runs out of free inodes, no further files or folders
can be created, even if plenty of free disk space is available.

Further increase in the number of used inode is likely to compromise the
availability of an application or of the complete system.

The following file systems exceed the threshold:

&critical_exceeded_list;

To view the current inode usage, run the "df -i" command with no parameters.

[solution critical_limit]
Free some inodes on the affected file systems. For example, delete obsolete
files and move directories to other file systems. Consider re-creating the
file system, with more inodes. For the options required to control the number
of inodes, see the mkfs.<filesystem> man page, where <filesystem> specifies
your file system type.

ATTENTION: Re-creating a file system destroys all contained data. Back up the
data on the file system before you start.

[reference critical_limit]
See the man page of the "df" command and of the "mkfs.<filesystem>" command
for your file system.
