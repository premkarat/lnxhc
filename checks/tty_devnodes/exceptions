[summary tty_has_multiple_nodes]
One or more terminals map to multiple device nodes: &var_node_list;

[explanation tty_has_multiple_nodes]
Device nodes for terminals are automatically created, for example,
by udev.  A device is identified by a major and minor device number
that corresponds to the device driver and a device node through
which programs can access the device.

The following terminals are accessible through multiple device nodes:

&var_node_table;

The standard node is based on the device name used by the terminal
device driver.  See /proc/tty/drivers for a mapping of standard nodes
and terminal device drivers.

Using different device nodes to access the same terminal device
might cause login failures, for example, if a getty program is
started on multiple device nodes at the same time.


[solution tty_has_multiple_nodes]
Only access the terminal through one device node.  Use the node that
matches the name used by the device driver.

Also check the installation and configuration of the Linux instance.
For example, there can be static device nodes in addition to those
created by udev.  Also see /etc/inittab or Upstart jobs to verify the
configuration of getty programs.
