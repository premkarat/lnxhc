[summary outdated_bootmap]
Boot records appear out of date, reboot might fail

[explanation outdated_bootmap]
The bootmap file is backlevel. You might no longer be able to boot your
Linux instance.

The bootmap file references files with boot data, such as a kernel image,
an initial RAM disk (initrd), and a kernel parameter file.
One or more of the referenced files have been modified after the bootmap file
was created. The "zipl" tool creates and updates the bootmap file on the
boot disk according to specifications in /etc/zipl.conf.

On the boot disk, check the time when the bootmap file was last changed.
View /etc/zipl.conf and identify the boot data files for the boot
configuration. Check the time when each of the referenced files was
last changed. The bootmap file must not be older than any of the referenced
files with boot data.

[solution outdated_bootmap]
Run the "zipl" command to update the bootmap file.

This check applies only if the following assumptions are all true:
- The boot device is a disk device.
- The bootmap file has been created from specifications in the "zipl"
  configuration file, /etc/zipl.conf.
- /etc/zipl.conf describes a single boot configuration that can but need not
  provide a boot menu.

If these assumptions do not apply to your Linux instance,
omit this check to suppress further warnings in the future.
