[summary single_slave]
These bonding interfaces aggregate only one network interface: &bond_devices;

[explanation single_slave]
A bonding interface is a logical interface that aggregates multiple slave interfaces.
One or more bonding interfaces aggregate only one network slave interface.
Bonding interfaces with only one slave interface neither provide path redundancy nor
increased bandwidth, and so do not help to increase availability or boost performance.
The following bonding interfaces aggregate only one slave interface:

&bond_slaves;

To verify that a bonding interface configured with single slave interface:
Issue a command of this form to obtain the slave list for a bonding device, bond<n>:
## cat /proc/net/bonding/bond<n>
where <n> is an index number that identifies the bonding interface.

[solution single_slave]
Reassign slave interfaces such that one bonding interface aggregates more than one slave interface.
For example, change the configuration script of a slave interface to persistently assign it to a
different bonding interface. Interface configuration scripts are usually found in the /etc branch
of the Linux file system and called ifcfg-<ifname>, where <ifname> is the interface name.
The exact location depends on your distribution.

In the script locate a line:
#MASTER=bond<n>
where bond<n> is the name of the bonding interface. Change this name to
reassign the slave interface to a different bonding interface.
The new assignment takes effect after Linux is
booted.
You can use the "ifenslave" command to temporarily reassign slave interfaces on a running Linux instance.

Issue a command of this form to detach an interface from a bonding interface:
## ifenslave -d <bonding_interface> <network_interface>
Issue a command of this form to attach an interface to a bonding interface:
## ifenslave <bonding_interface> <network_interface>
