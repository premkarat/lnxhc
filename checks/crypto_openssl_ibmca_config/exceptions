The path to libibmca.so in &openssl_cnf_path; is not correct

[explanation so_file_path_not_correct]
The &openssl_cnf_path; configuration file specifies the
path to the libibmca.so library in the Linux file system. The
libibmca.so library is not available at the specified location.

The current specification is:
#dynamic_path  =  &libibmca_so_file_path_in_config_file;

The specification should be:
#dynamic_path  =  &libibmca_so_file_path;

Find the following line:
#dynamic_path  =  &libibmca_so_file_path_in_config_file;
Changes this line to:
#dynamic_path  =  &libibmca_so_file_path;
