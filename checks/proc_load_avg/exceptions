[summary over_load]
System is overloaded

[explanation over_load]
When a system is overloaded, the system and existing programs slow down and
become much more unresponsive and difficult or even impossible to use.

Statistics:
&over_load;

[solution over_load]
Examine the processes/applications hogging cpu and terminate them if not
required.

Run "top" command, it displays top processes with high cpu usage.

To kill the process that hogs cpu issue the following command:

#kill -9 <pidofprocess>

To monitor processes performing IO, issue the following command:

#iotop

Disk IO statistics can be verified by iostat command (part of the sysstat
package):

#iostat

[reference over_load]
Refer to the man pages of "top", "iotop" and "iostat".

[summary high_load]
System is highly loaded

[explanation high_load]
When a system is highly loaded, there is a possible risk of system and existing
programs getting slow down and become much more unresponsive and difficult or
even impossible to use.

Statistics:
&high_load;

[solution high_load]
Current cpu utilization of processes can be verified by top command. Examine the
processes/applications hogging cpu and terminate them if not required.

Run "top" command, it displays top processes with high cpu usage.

To kill the process that hogs cpu issue the following command:

#kill -9 <pidofprocess>

To monitor processes performing IO, issue the following command:

#iotop

Disk IO statistics can be verified by iostat command (part of the sysstat
package):

#iostat

[reference high_load]
Refer to man pages of "top", "iotop" and "iostat".
