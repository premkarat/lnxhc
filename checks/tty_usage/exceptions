[summary unused_ttys]
These terminals are unused: &var_short_list;

[explanation unused_ttys]
There are one or more unused terminal devices.  Terminal devices
are intended to provide a user interface to a Linux instance.
Without an associated program, a terminal device does not serve
this purpose.

These terminal devices are unused:

&var_tty_list;

To confirm that no program is configured for a terminal device,
issue "ps -ef |grep <terminal>".  Where <terminal> specifies the
terminal device node without the leading /dev/.


[solution unused_ttys]
Configure a getty program for each unused terminal.  Depending on
your distribution, you might have to create an inittab entry or an
Upstart job.  For details, see the documentation that is provided
with your distribution.

If you want to accept unused terminals, add them to the "exclude_tty"
check parameter to suppress this warning in the future.
