Identify unused terminals (TTY)

[description]
Verify that terminal (TTY) devices are used, for example,

Terminal devices are intended to provide a user interface to a
Linux instance.  Without an associated program, a terminal device
does not serve this purpose.


[param exclude_tty]

check, for example, because they are deliberately unused.

Terminals are specified by their device node without the leading /dev/.
Use an asterisk (*) to match any string of characters.
For example, "ttyS3 hvc*" excludes /dev/ttyS3, /dev/hvc0, /dev/hvc1, ...
