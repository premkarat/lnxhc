[summary hba_not_usable]
The recovery of these FCP devices failed: &failed_fcp_devices;

[explanation hba_not_usable]
The FCP devices with the following bus-IDs are unable to recover from failures
and cannot be used:

|Device bus-ID
&failed_fcp_devices_table;

To manually verify if the problem still exists read the content of this
file:

## cat /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/failed

An output of "1" signifies that the problem still exists. An output of "0"
signifies that the problem does not exist.

[solution hba_not_usable]
If the recovery failed, please perform these manual steps:

1. Check the previous error kernel messages for the same FCP device
   to find the cause of the problem.
2. If the recovery failed write "0" to the failed attribute.
   Issue the following command at the shell prompt:
   ## echo '0' > /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/failed
3. Wait for 5 seconds.
4. Issue the following command to ensure that all udev events are processed:
   ## udevadm settle
5. Check the value of failed attribute.
   For example, issue:
   ## cat /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<device_bus_id>/failed

   If the value is "1" the recovery failed again, because the root cause
   resolution in step 1 was not sufficient.
