Identify I/O devices that are not associated with a device driver

[description]
When an I/O device is sensed, the associated device driver should
automatically be loaded. I/O devices that are not associated with
a device driver cannot be used properly.

Possible reasons for this problem are that the required device driver
module has been unloaded, that an existing association between the device and
the device driver has been removed, or that the device is not supported.

This check identifies devices that, in sysfs, do not have a symbolic link
to a device driver.
