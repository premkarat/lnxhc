[summary no_driver]
One or more I/O devices are not associated with a device driver: &devices_list;

[explanation no_driver]
One or more I/O devices cannot be used properly because they not associated
with a device driver.

Possible reasons for this problem are that the required device driver module
has been unloaded, that an existing association between the device and the
device driver has been removed, or that the device is not supported.

The following I/O devices are not associated with a device driver:

&all_devices;

Each device has a device type and a control unit (CU) type. Each device driver
provides a list of supported combinations of device type and CU type. Linux
uses this information to associate devices with device drivers. The sysfs
directories of devices with a device-driver association include a symbolic
link "driver". This link points to the sysfs directory of the associated
device driver.

To verify that an I/O device with bus ID <device_bus_id> is not associated with
a device driver, confirm that there is no symbolic link "driver" in the
following sysfs directory:
#/sys/bus/ccw/devices/<device_bus_id>

[solution no_driver]
1. If the kernel module of the required device driver has been unloaded,
   load it again. For example, issue:

   #modprobe <module_name>

   where <module_name> is the name of the required device driver module.
   You can use the "modinfo" command to find out which combinations of device
   type and CU type are supported by a device driver module.

2. Try to create the missing association of the I/O device with its
   device driver. For example, issue:

   #echo <device_bus_id> > /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/<module_name>/bind

   Alternatively, try to create the association by issuing:

   #echo <device_bus_id> > /sys/bus/ccw/drivers_probe

3. Verify that the device is supported.

4. If you cannot establish an association between the I/O device and a
   device driver, contact your support organization.
