[summary inactive]
Automatic problem reporting is disabled

[explanation inactive]
With the automatic problem reporting feature, problem data is
automatically collected and sent to IBM service.  Without this feature,
you need to collect the data manually using the appropriate tools and
contact IBM service, for example, to open a new Problem Management
Record (PMR).


[solution inactive]
Omit this check unless a hardware support agreement with IBM is in place
and the hardware is enabled for the Remote Support Facility.

To temporarily activate automatic problem reporting on a running
Linux instance, run
## sysctl -w kernel.callhome=1

To persistently activate automatic problem reporting, ensure that the
/etc/sysctl.conf file contains an entry for "kernel.callhome" and that
this entry reads:
#kernel.callhome=1

If your Linux distribution uses an /etc/sysctl.d directory, you can also
create a separate file with this entry in that directory.

Also ensure that the "sclp_async" kernel module is loaded before
sysctl settings are applied.  See the documentation of your Linux
distribution to automatically load kernel modules during the boot process.

  and sysctl.conf (section 5) man pages.

[summary not_available]
The automatic problem reporting feature is not available

[explanation not_available]
The automatic problem reporting feature is not available on your Linux
instance.  A possible reason is that the kernel module with this feature
is not loaded.

With the automatic problem reporting feature, problem data is
automatically collected and sent to IBM service.  Without this feature,
you need to collect the data manually using the appropriate tools and
contact IBM service, for example, to open a new Problem Management
Record (PMR).


[solution not_available]
Omit this check unless the following conditions apply:
- Your distribution includes the automatic problem reporting feature.
- A hardware support agreement with IBM is in place and
  the hardware is enabled for the Remote Support Facility.

If the check is applicable to your Linux instance, ensure that the
"sclp_async" module is loaded, for example, by issuing:
## modprobe sclp_async


[reference not_available]
- For information about loading modules, see the man page of the
  "modprobe" command.
