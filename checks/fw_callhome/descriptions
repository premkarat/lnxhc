Confirm that automatic problem reporting is activated

[description]
When Linux experiences a kernel panic, the automatic problem reporting
feature sends collected problem data to the IBM service organization
Hence a system crash automatically leads to a new Problem Management
Record (PMR), which can be processed by IBM service.

Omit this check unless a hardware support agreement with IBM is in place
and the hardware is enabled for the Remote Support Facility.
