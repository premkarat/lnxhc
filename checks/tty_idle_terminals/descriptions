Identify idle terminals


[description]
Identify terminals on which users are logged in but are not active.
Each logged-in user occupies a terminal that could be used
by another user.


[param idle_time]
Specifies the maximum idle time to be tolerated.
Valid values are positive integers followed by d, h, m, or s for
days, hours, minutes, or seconds.

If a user exceeds this idle time, an exception message is issued.


[param tty]
A blank-separated list of terminals.
The check identifies idle users who are logged in through the specified
terminals.  If the list is empty, all terminals are checked.

Terminals are specified by their device node without the leading /dev/.
Use an asterisk (*) to match any string of characters.
For example, "ttyS3 hvc*" matches /dev/ttyS3, /dev/hvc0, /dev/hvc1, ...
