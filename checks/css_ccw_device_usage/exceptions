[summary many_unused_devices]
Of &total_devices; I/O devices, &offline_devices; (&ratio;%) are unused

[explanation many_unused_devices]
The number of unused (offline) I/O devices, &offline_devices; (&ratio;%) of
a total of &total_devices;, exceeds the specified threshold.

During the boot process, Linux senses and analyzes all available I/O devices,
including unused devices. Therefore, unused devices unnecessarily consume
memory and CPU time. Similarly, memory and CPU resources are wasted for unused
I/O devices when new I/O devices or I/O paths become available or when
existing I/O devices or I/O paths become unavailable.

Use the "lscss" command to investigate which I/O devices are unused.
For unused devices the "Use" column is blank; for online devices this column
contains the value "yes".

[solution many_unused_devices]
Use the "cio_ignore" feature to exclude I/O devices that you do not need from
being sensed and analyzed. Be sure not to inadvertently exclude
required devices.

To exclude devices, you can use the "cio_ignore" kernel parameter or a command
like this:
#echo "add <device_bus_id>" > /proc/cio_ignore
where <device_bus_id> is the bus ID of an I/O device to be excluded.

If your distribution includes the "cio_ignore" command, you can also use this
command to exclude I/O devices from being sensed and analyzed.
