[title]
Minimal report consumer

[description]
This consumer shows a progress bar and lists exception IDs. When run in
verbose mode (command line option -V specified), it also lists detailed
exception messages with the option to run these through a pager program
such as "less".

[param pager]
Specify a pager program such as "less" to use for viewing detailed exception
messages when running this consumer in verbose mode (command line option -V
specified). If set to an empty value, the exception messages will be written
directly to the output stream.
