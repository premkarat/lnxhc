lnxhc - Linux Health Checker

ABOUT

  The Linux Health Checker is a command line tool for Linux. Its purpose
  is to identify potential problems before they impact your system's
  availability or cause outages. It collects and compares the active
  Linux settings and system status for a system with the values provided
  by health-check authors or defined by you. It produces output in the
  form of detailed messages, which provide information about potential
  problems and the suggested actions to take.

  The Linux Health Checker will run on any Linux platform which meets
  the software requirements. It can be easily extended by writing new
  health check plug-ins.

  The Linux Health Checker is an open source project sponsored by IBM.
  It is released under the Eclipse Public License v1.0

GETTING STARTED

  1. Ensure that your system meets the software requirements:
     - Perl version 5.8 or later
     - Basic Perl modules which should be part of a common Perl
       installation

  2. Install the lnxhc package. The latest version is available both
     as RPM and source packages from the download page:

       http://lnxhc.sourceforge.net/download.html

     When using the source package, enter:

       make all install

  3. At a command line prompt, enter:

       lnxhc run

     Note that some health checks may require root privileges to obtain
     required information. If run as another user, the Linux Health
     Checker will use the sudo mechanism to obtain the necessary
     privileges.

  4. The resulting command output will contain summary information about
     identified problems. To get detailed output, use the following
     command:

       lnxhc run --replay -V
